          abstract: ' Accurate sleep stage scoring is crucial for diagnosing sleep disorders. Current methods like Polysomnography (PSG) are time-consuming and costly. This study explores photoplethysmography (PPG) as a non-invasive, cost-effective alternative for classifying all five sleep stages.The model achieved benchmarking result out of existing state of art model. Conclusion: PPG-ViT-NET demonstrates strong performance, showing potential to replace traditional PSG methods for sleep stage classification. Significance: This study paves the way for using PPG and deep learning in wearable devices for at-home sleep monitoring, offering an ergonomic and scalable solution..',
